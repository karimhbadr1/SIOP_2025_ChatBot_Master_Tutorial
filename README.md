## Abstract

In this tutorial, we introduce automatic Information Retrieval Q&A Systems (IRQAS) tailored for I/O Psychology, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o. We spotlight CESAIR, a system optimized for answering usersâ€™ questions basing answers on a library of documents defined by the owner. We will provide practical guidance on how to use CESAIR effectively in I/O relevant settings. Designed for I/O practitioners and academics with no LLMs and limited coding expertise, participants will learn to comprehend, evaluate, and utilize IRQAS.
